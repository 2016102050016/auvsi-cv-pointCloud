# auvsi-cv-pointCloud
Learn how to read, load and visualize point clouds using MATLAB and pre-process the data by down sampling and de-noising. You will also learn how to apply affine transforms like translation and rotation. Finally, you will learn how to fit point clouds to geometric shapes and how to extract a region of interest from images using point clouds.
